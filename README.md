# Narrow Band Frequency Modulation And Demodulation
This assignment is in the course of Analogue communication. It's about the __NBFM__ modulation and demodulation of voice messages.

The procedures in this assignment aim to simulate ideal radio communication (i.e. no noise is present).

## Files :
* __eric.wav__ : the sound message.
* __NBFM_comm.mlx__ : MatLab live script. (better for understanding and investigation)
* __NBFM_script.m__ : MatLab script.
* __Report.pdf__ : a report. (obviously :laughing:)
